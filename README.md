# PagingCompose-Sample
This is a sample project which demonstrates how to create infinite lists üìãüìã with Paging 3 library in Jetpack Compose using modern Android Architecture Components(Kotlin, MVVM, Flow, Jetpack Compose, Paging 3 Library, Android Jetpack).

## About
This sample application loads a list of movies from the [Tmdb Api](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3).

It loads the data from the internet with `Retofit` library as a `Movie` object, then the `Paging` 3 library converts the fetched data into `Flow<PagingData<Movie>>` 
and updates the flow with new data when the end of the page is reached. The application then collects the flow of data then displays it into a list.

## Building the project ‚öíüõ†‚õè
The sample application uses the [Tmdb Api](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) to load the list of movies. To successfully build the application 
you need to create a [api key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

Then you need to add the api key in `local.properties` file in your project root folder as shown below:

```TMDB_API_KEY = "your-api-key"```
